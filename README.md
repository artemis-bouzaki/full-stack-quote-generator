## This is a mini fullstack project hosted on netlify. The website can be found here: https://incredible-narwhal-a9c8a6.netlify.app/

The frontend was created using HTML CSS and Javascript and the server was created using Express.
When it was hosted locally, the application retrieved the quotes from mysql database connection. However, 
this was changed to make deployment on Github simpler ( some of the old code remains there for reference).

Version control was used to track changes.
